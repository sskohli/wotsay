<h1>Wotsay - Introduction</h1>
<div><strong>Background</strong>:</div>
<div>There are a number of  different organizations who conduct surveys on a regular basis. These  companies include Marketing Companies, Consulting Companies, News  Channels, Political Parites etc. These companies hire third party  companies to conduct these surveys. These companies go in the field and  interact with individuals to conduct these surveys. These surveys are  mostly taken on paper and then begins the arduous task of data entry and  adding these surveys to a computer in order to analyze and make sense  of the data.<br clear="none" />
</div>

</div>
<div><strong>Challenges: </strong>There are many challenges to the traditional method of conducting surveys:<br clear="none" />
</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Targeted Audience</strong>:  Most surveys are targeted to a specific target group, like school going  girls, middle class housewives, unemployed graduates, etc. It is very  difficult to find this target group. The effort would involve time and  money.</li>
  <li><strong> Effort</strong>: In any survey the effort in  terms of manpower and money is quite high. Surveys need to be printed,  distributed,  geographies identified, then individuals need to go in  person to conduct these surveys. It' a mammoth exercise.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Unwilling Audience</strong>:  There is no incentive to complete a survey. Why would an person who's  late to office would stop to listen and answer stupid questions about  him? With increasing crimes, housewives will not allow strangers to come  to their house to fill a questionnaire.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Since there is so much effort required to fill a survey and the  audience is not forthcoming, the individuals conducting the survey  themselves enter the answers or just get them randomly filled.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Wotsay to the rescue: </strong>Wotsay! is an incentive based mobile/web platform where the <strong>registered </strong>users willingly answer questions in lieu of benefits.<br clear="none" />
</div>
<div><strong>Advantages:</strong><br clear="none" />
</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Handpicked Audience:</strong> When a user registers with Wotsay, he/she provides valuable demographic  information. Companies can thus handpick their audience based on their  criteria and the survey would be delivered specifically to the targeted  audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimal Effort: </strong>Companies would not  need to go door to door to conduct surveys. All they need to do is  create a questionnaire, choose an audience and deliver the survey. They  decide how much they want to spend on a campaign and the survey would be  delivered accordingly.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Incentivized Audience: </strong>The  audience can check and respond to surveys at their own convenience,  whenever they're free. Since there is an incentive for them to answer,  they're more than willing to answer and also advertise the product.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Authenticity: </strong>Every  user is registered on the system. Companies can cross-check and analyze  the results based on this user data. No more random and incomplete  entries.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Live Reports:</strong> The  companies can view the response of their surveys immediately and in real  time. They no longer have to wait for the survey to be administered,  collected and then fed into the system to view the results. Numerous  Graphical reports can be created to analyze and categorize the response  data.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Who would be our initial target audience?</strong><br clear="none" />
</div>
<div>To  introduce and spread our app we need an audience who would be willing  to use our app and will be more than happy to spread. Now we would be  giving incentive on profile creation and reference.</div>
<div>In India, who will this dynamic audience be. We envision our initial target audience would be:</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Tech savvy students</strong>,  who own a smartphone and/or a laptop. They always want to try out new  things and if there's an incentive, even better. These also have closed  knit communities and would easily spread the app.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>House Wives:</strong> These have a lot of free time and are very active on their smartphones,  whatsapp, facebook. They would definitely try out something if there is  an incentive and will spread the word to their peers.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Middle Class Salesmen</strong>:  These are metro train commuting individuals who have a lot of free time  during their commute and would love to earn a quick buck.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Freshers and lower level executives</strong>:  These are fresh out of college and are just starting or have been in  their jobs for a couple of years. They have limited pay but high dreams  and wouldn't mind earning something on the extra.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
</ul>
<div><br clear="none" />
</div>
<div><strong>Where would be target these audience or where do we advertise?</strong><br clear="none" />
</div>
<div>In order to spread our word effectively, we need to understand our target audience and target them accordingly. <br clear="none" />
</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Students</strong>: We need to advertise near schools/colleges/tuition centers. Probably banners or on facebook?<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li><strong>House Wives: </strong>We need to target grocery stores, malls, temples, during afternoon tv shows, kitty party venues.<br clear="none" />

  </li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Incentives:</strong><br clear="none" />
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Initially,  we wouldn't want to involve any monetary incentive as it would involve a  payment gateway, etc. We would want the incentive to be lucrative for  the user and would want the users to continuously/repeatedly use our  app.<br clear="none" />
  </li>
  <li>We surveyed and most of the target audience would be interested in getting <strong>free talktime. </strong><br clear="none" />
